## Overview

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use linear-gradients.

```css
.card {
  background: linear-gradient(var(--blue), var(--red))
}
```

### Continued development

I hope to continue working on my Flexbox skills and maybe delv into Grid soon.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) This bot is truly amazing! It helped me figure out how to apply transition effects for the background property of a button.
